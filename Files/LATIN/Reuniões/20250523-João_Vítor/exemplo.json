      "text": "Product Description It's hard to find a good balance between the traction of low tire pressure and reducing the risk of pinch flats. Many riders opt for heavy tubes or mousses, but the Nuetech Tubliss Gen 2.0 Tire System is a relatively new solution that uses a clever design to eliminate pinch flats, bad traction, and tubes entirely. The Tubliss System works by replacing your conventional inner tube with a smaller, higher pressure insert that hugs the inside of your rim. This creates two separate pressure areas inside your tire. One area inside the high pressure insert, and another lower-pressure area that fills the rest of your tire where your old tube used to be. Inflate the high-pressure insert and it locks the bead in place, forming a seal against the rim and acting like a bumper that protects the rim from impact. With the high-pressure insert filled, the lower-pressure area can be inflated like a traditional tubeless tire you would find on a car. With the Tubliss Tire System installed there are no tubes to pinch, plug kits are a more viable repair option, and you can run much lower psi without your bead rolling off since the high pressure air chamber will still have it locked down. Plenty of riders swear by the Tubliss System and for many enduro, GNCC, or off-road riders it's a great alternative to a traditional setup. Watch our video above for more detailed information on the Nuetech Tubliss Gen 2.0 Tire System and see if it will work for you.

      "text": "Product Description High-Quality Road Bike Tires and Inner Tubes for All-Season Use It all starts with high-quality rubber. Designed specifically for road bikes, this replacement tire uses dual-compound tread to ensure optimum grip and wear resistance. The dual-compound is evenly molded into a thick rubber tread and casing to provide excellent resistance to cuts and punctures. The tube can withstand high PSIs (up to 120psi!) and remain airtight, removing the need for constant reinflation. Made from high-quality, durable, and weatherproof butyl rubber, this inner tube is thick yet stretchable. More important than its thickness, each inner tube is evenly molded, ensuring that there are no thin spots that will weaken and deform the inner tube as it expands. Dependable 42mm Presta Valve Stems Presta valves offer both convenience and security. Specifically designed for high-performance tires and wheels, these valves are thinner and lighter. Its thin frame only requires a 6mm hole in the road bike's rim, improving the rim's strength and performance. As a standard centered valve, the valve stem seats securely on the walls of the inner tubes, preventing leaks from the valve junction. Also, the valve's 42mm (1.8 inches) length makes on-the-spot inflation a breeze. The varying lengths of Presta valves ensure that there's enough length poking out (at least 1.5 inches) from the rim for ease in attaching a pump. The brass reinforcement on the valve stem's body also makes the valve more rigid and secure, especially as you'll need to screw and unscrew a small part, the valve nut to open and close the valve during inflation. Air loss is minimal with the valve stem caps providing additional protection not only from leaks but also from debris. The AR-PRO Quality Guarantee Our line of replacement road bike tires and inner tubes are must-haves for serious and casual road bike owners alike.

Insert one tire lever into the wheel rim and pry up the edge of the tire (be careful to avoid piercing the inner tube), and then pry the inner edge of the tire out of the wheel rim; make the wheel rim rotate by one eighth of a turn and then repeat the above-mentioned process while keeping the first tire lever in the original position. Now insert the second tire lever and slide it to separate a single side of the tire from the wheel rim. Detach the tire and the inner tube completely, and check if there is any broken stones or sharp objects left in the tire, and clear those things up if any. Read more Put an inner tube in (please noted that the new inner tube should be inflated with a little bit air to keep a tubular shape before it is installed). Please make sure that the whole inner tube is installed evenly without any protrusion. Start from the valve and put the left side of the tire into the wheel rim with your thumb, and you may also use the tire lever to put the tire back. When both the inner tube and the tire have been installed in the rim, inflate the inner tube with 10PSI air and then check whether the inner tube has been locked in the rim properly and, if so, continue to inflate the inner tube to the standard pressure.

Our Xtreme Cling foam is designed to cling vigorously to vertical surfaces and dissolve anything between your wheels and a brilliant shine! Safe on all clear coated wheels. Amazon.com Meguiar\u2019s Hot Rims All Wheel and Tire Cleaner is designed to be safe on all clear coated wheels and wash grime with ease, leaving behind not only clean wheels, but clean tire sidewalls as well. Its unique foaming solution, Xtreme Cling is designed to cling to vertical surfaces and break down stubborn road residue from both metal and rubber. With Meguiar\u2019s Hot Rims All Wheel and Tire Cleaner, car lovers can feel the satisfaction of a deep cleaning session by watching the Xtreme Cling solution foam, turning from white to brown as it grabs all brake dust build up and grime. What\u2019s more, this unique product is safe to use on all factory-coated wheels, taking the stress of finding the right wheel cleaner out of the equation. Before Cleaning the Wheels Know that there is a variety: The first step in wheel care is recognizing that not all wheels are made the same. Wheels are made from different types of materials and coatings. The product used on the wheels is determined by the surface which can range anywhere from chrome, powder coated, painted, to polished aluminum and many more. Identify what is being driven on: The next step is to determine what kind of wheels on the vehicle. Most wheels that come with a factory-purchased vehicle are clear coated wheels. However if they have been replaced with aftermarket wheels, find out the surface material by contacting the manufacturer. Some wheels may even be coated with two or three different types of coatings, depending on how customized they are. Choosing The Right Wheel Cleaner When using a wheel cleaner to remove brake dust and grime there are three products Meguiar\u2019s that are available to choose from: Meguiar\u2019s Hot Rims Aluminum Wheel Cleaner, Meguiar\u2019s Hot Rims All Wheel and Tire Cleaner, and Meguiar\u2019s Hot Rims Chrome Wheel Cleaner. Meguiar\u2019s Hot Rims Aluminum Wheel Cleaner is safe for uncoated or polished aluminum, anodized and powder coated wheels. This is the safest Meguiar\u2019s wheel cleaner and is also recommended if the wheel type cannot be determined. Meguiar\u2019s Hot Rims All Wheel and Tire Cleaner is safe for all factory coated wheels. Meguiar\u2019s Hot Rims Chrome Wheel Cleaner is specifically designed for all chrome plated wheels, and is sure to give a mirror-like finish. Knowing the Consequences of Choosing the Incorrect Wheel Cleaner Using the wrong product with the wrong surface can potentially cause permanent damage to the surface of the wheels, brake or even suspension components. Make sure to read the label on any product used and check that it is meant to work with the wheels\u2019 surface. If unsure of the wheel type and unable to contact the manufacturer, start with the most gentle wheel cleaner and testing a small area. Applying Meguiar\u2019s Hot Rims All Wheel and Tire Cleaner For best results, apply in a well-ventilated area, one wheel at a time. It is not safe for motorcycle wheels or aftermarket, painted or colored brake components. 1. Rinse wheel thoroughly with cold water. 2. Coat wheels and tires with Meguiar\u2019s Hot Rims All Wheel and Tire Cleaner holding bottle 6-8 inches away. Coat one wheel at a time. 3. Wait 15 seconds to allow foaming cleaners to penetrate and dissolve build-up. For heavy build-up, agitate surface with brush. 4. Rinse thoroughly with water. 5.
